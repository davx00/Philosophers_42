## 🧩 Overview

The **Dining Philosophers** problem is a classic synchronization problem involving a certain number of philosophers sitting around a table doing one of three things:
- **Thinking**
- **Eating**
- **Sleeping**

Each philosopher needs **two forks** to eat, but each fork is shared between neighbors. The goal is to manage access to the forks **without causing deadlocks, starvation, or race conditions**.

---

## 📜 Project Rules

- Each philosopher is represented by a thread.
- You must protect shared data using **mutexes**.
- No data races or deadlocks are allowed.
- You must handle timing accurately (usleep, gettimeofday, etc).
- A philosopher dies if they don’t eat within a certain time.
- Output should be clean, formatted, and ordered correctly.
- Must be written in **C**, using **pthreads**.
